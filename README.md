# NYC Regent Score Exploration in R

[Full Report](report.pdf)

## Abstract
Covid-19 had a huge impact on children, especially on education. Families in poor communities might not have the resources and technology for their child to succeed in learning while at home. These families also might have had a rough time dealing with finances and school wouldn’t have been a priority for them. Using data from the New York State Education Department on all the districts in NYC, compare scores prior to covid-19 to scores after for each district to see if there’s a significant difference between poor and rich districts and push for more funding in poor communities.

## Hypothesis / Goal
I hypothesize economically worse off schools would have less funding since NYC schools get some of its funding directly from its neighborhood property tax. Therefore, if a neighborhood is a slum and the buildings there aren’t worth as much, the school would get less funding as the government would collect less property taxes.  

## Data Collection
Find data on the regents scores scored and funding each school gets for the 32 NYC School Districts. Find which district is worse/better off economically and then compare the regent scores before and after Covid-19.
